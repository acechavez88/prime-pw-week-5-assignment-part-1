/* 1. Create an object literal to represent you!
  - Give the object a 'firstName & (separate) 'lastName' property
  - Give it a boolean 'hasSiblings' property
  - Give it  a numeric 'shoeCount' property
  - Also give it an array 'favThreeFoods'
*/

  // TODO - add properties here
};
console.log('A little about me:', me);// confirmed in console me info updated..

/* 2. Accessing object properties.
  - Create a variable called fullName
  - Use the firstName & lastName properties of the object you
    created above to set its value.
  - Console.log fullName
*/
var fullName = (me.firstName + me.lastName);// updated with dot accessor..

console.log(fullName);// confirmed in console.log..


/* 3. Nested arrays
  - Console.log your first favorite food
  - Console.log your last favorite food
*/

console.log(firstFavFood);
var lastFavFood = (me.favThreeFoods[2]);//first attempt.. confirmed in console..
console.log(lastFavFood);

/* 4. Change a property of an existing object.
  - Console.log your current shoe count.
  - Guess what?! You just got a new pair of shoes!!!
  - Set your object's shoeCount to be what it was plus 1
  - Console.log your updated shoe count.
*/
console.log(me.shoeCount)// confirmed in console.log..
var NewShoeCount = me.shoeCount += 1;
 console.log(NewShoeCount);//getting new shoes.. add 1..
 // confirmed in console log and new value is 4..!
 console.log(me.shoeCount);// confirmed shoe count in console reads 4..

/* 5. Add a new property to an existing object.
  - Add a 'favoriteColor' to your existing object
  - Do this the same way you updated the variable above
  - Cool huh? It works, even though it wasn't there before
  - Console.log your object
